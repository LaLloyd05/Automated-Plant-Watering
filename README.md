# Automated-Plant-Watering
This project demonstrates intermediate wiring and coding to create an automated watering plant system.

This project will detect soil mositure through a soil moisture probe and determining at a certain threshold, activates a relay, connected to a water pump, provide water to the plant. 

# Components
We utilized many components such as:
 
  * Rasberry Pie Pico:
  
  Serving as the central processing unit(CPU), responsible for data processing, decision-making, and controlling of other components.
 
  * Relay:  SRD-05VDC-SL-C 1 Channel 5V Relay Module 250VAC/10A, 30VDC/10A
  
  *DC Motor Water Pump:
  
  Draws water from a resevior to plants root system

  * Soil Moisture Probe:
  
  Measures the moisture level of the soil at regualr intervals. Typically, consists of two electrodes that gauge the soil's electrical conductivity, correlating with its moisture content.
