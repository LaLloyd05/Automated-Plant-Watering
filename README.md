# Automated-Plant-Watering
This project demonstrates intermeidate wiring and coding to create an automated watering plant system.

This project will detect soil mositure and determine at a certain threshold when to activate the relay and provide water to the plant. 

We utilized many components such as:
 
  -Rasberry Pie Pico:
  Serving as the central processing unit(CPU), responsible for data processing, decision-making, and controlling of other components.
 
  -Relay:  SRD-05VDC-SL-C 1 Channel 5V Relay Module 250VAC/10A, 30VDC/10A
  
  -DC Motor Water Pump:
  Draws water from a resevior to plants root system

  -Soil Moisture Probe:
  Measures the moisture level of the soil at regualr intervals. Typically, consists of two electrodes that gauge the soil's electrical conductivity, correlating with its moisture content.


Coding Software Platform

-Micro Python
